    "longDescription": "The Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo, designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa in 1972, is an emblematic example of the metabolist movement. Founded in Japan in the 1960s, architectural metabolism adopts an organic, evolutionary vision of urban design. This modular tower perfectly represents this philosophy, incorporating interchangeable prefabricated capsules, symbolizing the idea of organic growth and constant adaptability in architectural design. The metabolic approach, exemplified by the Nakagin Capsule Tower, aims to create flexible, evolving urban environments, reflecting the movement's forward-looking vision of dynamic, ever-changing urban development. Kurokawa's innovative design, marked by its modular elements, positions this tower as a symbol of the metabolist movement's commitment to envisioning cities as dynamic and ever-evolving entities.",
